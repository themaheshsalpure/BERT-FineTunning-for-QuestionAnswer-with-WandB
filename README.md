## Project Title: BERT Fine-tuning for Question Answering with W&B Evaluation

### Overview:
This project aims to fine-tune the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for question answering using a custom dataset. The fine-tuning process is documented in the notebook BERT_finetuning_QuestionAnswer.ipynb. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated using Weights & Biases (W&B), and the evaluation report is summarized in the bert_report file. Screenshots of the W&B dashboard showcasing relevant graphs are provided as wandb1.png and wandb2.png.

### Contents:
BERT_finetuning_QuestionAnswer.ipynb:

These screenshots depict the graphs generated on the W&B dashboard during the model evaluation process. They offer visual representations of key metrics such as training loss, validation accuracy, and other relevant parameters.
Why W&B (Weights & Biases)?
### Weights & Biases (W&B) is a powerful tool for experiment tracking and visualization. Here's why it was used in this project:

### Experiment Tracking: 
W&B facilitates tracking various experiments, including hyperparameters, metrics, and model configurations, making it easier to compare different runs and understand their impact on model performance.

### Visualization:
W&B provides intuitive visualizations of model training and evaluation metrics, enabling quick insights into the model's behavior and performance trends.

### Collaboration:
W&B allows for easy sharing and collaboration on experimental results, fostering team collaboration and enabling efficient communication of findings.

### Reproducibility: 
With W&B, experiment configurations and results are stored in a centralized dashboard, enhancing reproducibility and ensuring that experiments can be recreated and verified.

Using W&B in conjunction with BERT fine-tuning enhances the project's transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency in analyzing and improving the model's performance.
